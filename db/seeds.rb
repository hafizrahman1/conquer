job8 = Job.create(description: "Imagine if you lived in a house for thirty years but always avoided one room. If, after all that time, you actually ventured into the mysterious room, you might feel a little tense and anxious. Why? Because the more we avoid something, the more we send the message to the unconscious mind that: 'This is dangerous, that is why I am avoiding it.' So your mind, trying to be helpful, builds up the fear (of what it is you're avoiding) even more. Spend 3 weeks where atleast 5 times a week you force yourself into a socially intense situation. Whether it’s meeting people at a restaurant, going out with friends, attending community meetings, and more. Exposing yourself to social sitations, will greatly help you overcome this irrational fear of socializing.")
job9 = Job.create(description: "Positive instructions. Rather than: 'I hope I don't feel terrified as usual' (which is like someone asking you directions by telling you where they don't want to end up), ask yourself: 'How do I want to feel in these situations?' And get into the habit of focusing on that. Give yourself a 'target feeling' by looking at times when you are comfortable with others (often old friends or trusted family members). Then you can prepare your mind to perform the way you want in social situations by using these situations as a template. To do this, close your eyes and get yourself nice and relaxed. Take some time to remember how it feels to be with these familiar people until you get a strong feeling of comfort. Then imagine seeing yourself in a formerly less comfortable social situation, but behaving like you do with your trusted friends. This sort of mental rehearsal is extremely powerful and over time can make a massive difference. Do these mental rehersals before every social siutation for 3 weeks. You will start to notice a significant difference.")
